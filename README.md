# ESP8266_IOT_MQTT_DHT22_VoltageSensor_Node


This is a base firmware of my IOT nodes for my SmartHome. The firmware send me a mqtt message about temperature and humidity over a dht22 sensor. I also included a analog sensor for getting a voltage, because I the nodes a powered by solar

This code will be updated, over the next few weeks, i will also attach my hardware setup the 3d printed enclosure (if i found the right one)
